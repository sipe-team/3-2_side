## Developing

### Create New Components
Use the CLI to create new components. The generated components will be placed under the `packages/` directory:
```sh
pnpm create:component
```

- **Naming Convention:** Use kebab-case for component names (e.g., `my-button`).
- **Styling:** Prioritize using predefined styles from the `tokens` package.

### Testing
We use **Vitest** for testing.  
All new features or changes must include **relevant test cases**.
```sh
pnpm test
```

### Storybook
We use **Storybook** for visual testing of components.  
All components must include Storybook documentation.  
Run the following command to view your components at `localhost:6006`:
```sh
pnpm dev:storybook
```
